 - (djm) Fix a bug: forgot to set the exception type when trying to get 
   RadixNode members that don't exist
 - (djm) Prepare for Radix.method(address, masklen) by extending radix API
 - (djm) Add regression tests (not yet integrated with build)
 - (djm) Always allocate user objects in RadixNode
 - (djm) API change: don't allow creation of arbirtary members in RadixNode.
   Instead, provide a data dict for storage of user-specified state. This 
   avoid all of the introspection breakage of providing our get/setattr 
   functions
 - (djm) Add RadixNode docstring
 - (djm) Add iterator support
 - (djm) Flesh out setup.py and add correct URL
 - (djm) Raise an exception when trying to mix V4 and V6 addresses in a single 
   tree (rather than continuing and returning confusing results). Hopefully 
   this will be fixed in the future

 - (djm) Start the changelog
 - (djm) Release alpha version: py-radix-0.1
