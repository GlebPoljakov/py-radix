py-radix is an implementation of a radix tree data structure for the storage 
and retrieval of IPv4 and IPv6 network prefixes.

The radix tree is the data structure most commonly used for routing table 
lookups. It efficiently stores network prefixes of varying lengths and 
allows fast lookups of containing networks.

py-radix is licensed under a ISC/BSD licence. The underlying radix tree 
implementation is taken (and modified) from MRTd and is subject to a 4-term 
BSD license. See the LICENSE file for details.

A simple example, that demonstrates most of the features:

	import radix

	# Create a new tree
	rtree = radix.Radix()

	# Adding a node returns a RadixNode object. You can creat
	# arbitrary members in this to store your data
	rnode = rtree.add("10.0.0.0/8")
	rnode.blah = "whatever you want"

	# Exact search will only return prefixes you have entered
	rnode = rtree.search_exact("10.0.0.0/8")
	# Get your data back out
	print rnode.blah

	# Best-match search will return the longest matching prefix
	# that contains the search term (routing-style lookup)
	rnode = rtree.search_best("10.123.45.6")

	# There are a couple of implicit members of a RadixNode:
	print rnode.network     # -> "10.0.0.0"
	print rnode.prefix      # -> "10.0.0.0/8"
	print rnode.prefixlen   # -> 8
	print rnode.family      # int (same as socket.AF_INET)

	# IPv6 prefixes are fully supported
	rnode = rtree.add("2001:200::/32")
	rnode = rtree.add("::/0")

	# Use the nodes() function to return all prefixes entered
	nodes = rtree.nodes()
	for rnode in nodes:
		print rnode.prefix
