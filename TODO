- Extend Radix.methods to take (network, prefixlen) arguments

- tree.delete(RadixNode)

- thread safety

- radix code doesn't check family, so users must keep separate trees
  - Keep a separate v4/v6 trees; vs.
  - Modify lookup/search to treat first bit as family==AF_INET?

tree.copy()

what happens to tree modifications during a walk?
 - next node could disappear from under us...
 - poison nodes on delete (should do anyway)
 - keep a ref to next node? must deref properly...
 - write a regress test
