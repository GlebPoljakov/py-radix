- Extend Radix.methods to take (network, prefixlen) arguments

- tree.delete(RadixNode)

- radix code doesn't check family, so users must keep separate trees if
  they want to store v4 and v6 addresses. two possible ways to fix this:
    - Keep a separate v4/v6 trees in RadixObject; vs.
    - Modify radix.c lookup/search to treat first bit as family==AF_INET?

tree.copy()
