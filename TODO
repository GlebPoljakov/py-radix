- Maybe Extend Radix methods to accept (network, mask) (contiguous masks only)

- tree.delete(RadixNode)

- radix code doesn't check family, so users must keep separate trees if
  they want to store v4 and v6 addresses. two possible ways to fix this:
    - Keep a separate v4/v6 trees in RadixObject; vs.
    - Modify radix.c lookup/search to treat first bit as family==AF_INET?


- regress tests for bad addresses / masklens
- regress tests for strange net/mask combos

tree.copy()
